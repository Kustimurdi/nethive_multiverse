The gaussian tasks do not work as intended when using multiple tasks. Individual tasks are learned by the bees. 
When training on multiple tasks without interaction one can see that the tasks are anti correlated. 
for long stretches of time the accuracy in the tasks does not change, this might make sense because if they are getting trained at two tasks 
at the same time any improvement in one task might come at the cost of the other task.
